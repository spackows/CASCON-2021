this video shows you how to create a Watson studio project 

00:00:05
from the home page you can create a project projects are way to organize resources for specific data science task or goal 

00:00:14
Rajit includes data collaborators notebooks models and SO one all to support finding insights for a well defined and fairly narrow goal for example how weather affects sales in the company's retail shops in this video you'll see how to create an empty project and imported project from a file into project based on a sample first to create an empty project 

00:00:43
just provide a name for the project and give it a description 

00:00:47
by default the project will be restricted in who can be added as a collaborator so you'll be able to invite anyone in your company or just members of your IBM cloud account depending on whether or not your company has salmon federation's set up 

00:01:04
this option also allows you to access assets from a catalog if you clear this restriction you will be able to invite anyone to collaborate on the project but you won't be able to access catalog assets this setting can't be changed later if you don't already have an IBM cloud object storage instance 

00:01:26
what do you want to create a new instance you'll be able to do that from here 

00:01:32
when you're ready click create 

00:01:35
so here's the new project you'll explore project a little later 

00:01:40
now let's go back to the home screen and create a project again this time select the option to create a project from a sample or file 

00:01:53
drag the file containing an exported Watson studio project here 

00:02:00
provide a name in the description 

00:02:03
thank read the project 

00:02:06
now Watson studio is creating the project space uploading and extracting the zip content and then transferring the files to the cloud object storage instance associated with this project 

00:02:21
when it's done you can either view the import summary or view the new project this is the project overview tab where you see basic information about the project including the description 

00:02:35
storage usage 

00:02:37
collaborators 

00:02:39
recent activity 

00:02:41
in a project read me 

00:02:43
on the assets tab you'll find all of the different types of assets you can add to a project such as data assets notebooks models flows and someone 

00:02:55
on the environment's tab you can define the hardware size and software configuration for the run time associated with Watson studio tools such as notebooks 

00:03:06
the jobs tab shows any scheduled active in previous jobs started from running an asset such as a notebook or data refinery flow from here you can view the details of each job and manage jobs 

00:03:21
the deployment stab will contain any models you've deployed for example machine learning models 

00:03:28
the access control tab lets you add and manage additional collaborators for your project 

00:03:35
on the settings tab you can edit the project name and description 

00:03:40
here you can see the storage used by the assets in this project 

00:03:45
and here's where you can associate additional services with this project such as spark machine learning streaming analytics dashboard or Watson services 

00:03:56
if you need a project access token to access files and connections using platform API's you can create one from here 

00:04:05
lastly you can connect this project to a get hub repository to be able to upload content to their or to your figure eight or define crowd account to create annotation jobs 

00:04:19
now let's go back to the home screen 

00:04:22
create a project again 

00:04:24
and select the option to create a project from a sample or file this time the project will be based on the sample hover over each sample to see a description in this case selected the predicted buying behavior with ML sample 

00:04:42
the project name and description are filled in for you so just click create 

00:04:50
when it's done view the new project 

00:04:54
on the assets tab you'll see the assets included with this sample project 

00:05:01
now you're ready to examine the sample assets and get started analyzing data 

00:05:08
