00:00:00
Thanks, everybody, for joining me for this short meeting. 

00:00:04
What I wanted to do, today, was to go around the room and asked people to share what is their favorite animal and why. 

00:00:17
Okay. My name is Heather and my favorite animal is a dog. 

00:00:21
And the reason that it's my favorite animal, probably a lot of people's favorite animal, because dogs are such loving companions who are so very loyal. 

00:00:33
And I feel like they seem to know when you need them to come snuggle by you. 

00:00:39
They're very perceptive of your feelings and they want to please you. 

00:00:44
And I don't think they're, well there are mean dogs, but overall most dogs are very lovable and only just want to please humans. 

00:00:55
And so I would say dogs are my favorite animal. 

00:00:59
I can go next. 

00:01:00
So, my name Sara, and every once in a while, I actually reflect on a different animal and I feel like I connect with a different one. 

00:01:09
But recently I've been thinking a lot about elephants, and I think elephants are really fascinating. 

00:01:13
They represent, in the African culture, they are a symbol of strength and power. 

00:01:20
And I also think they resemble wisdom. 

00:01:24
So yeah, I just think it's interesting, because we don't get to see them that often. 

00:01:28
Usually, the first thing I would think about, when I'm asked about my favorite animal, I would say a pet animal. 

00:01:35
But yeah, I just find animals in the wild are also very fascinating, very interesting to explore and learn more about them. 

00:01:45
Well, similar to Sara, I'd have to say maybe my favorite animal would be maybe giraffes, because I've always thought they look very, they were very unique. 

00:01:57
And whenever I went to a zoo, or anything like that, I'd always look forward to seeing the giraffes. 

00:02:02
So yeah, I'd say giraffe. 

00:02:04
Maybe ten years ago, if you had asked me my favorite animal, I would have said the horse. 

00:02:09
And they're pretty up there, still. 

00:02:12
But we happened to get a donkey a couple of years ago, because a neighbor was getting a bit older and couldn't look after her anymore himself as easily. 

00:02:22
So, she just came over the fence to our property instead, and he can still visit her. 

00:02:28
But that's the first donkey I'd ever met, and I have to say: she's amazing! 

00:02:34
So, now, I would say my favorite animal is donkeys. 

00:02:38
They're kind of like a horse and a dog, in their personality. 

00:02:43
And I have to say she is smarter than I am; I fully acknowledge that. 

00:02:49
Donkeys are quite amazing.
