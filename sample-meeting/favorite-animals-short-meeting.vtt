Thanks, everybody, for joining me for this short meeting. 

00:04.100 --> 00:17.000
What I wanted to do, today, was to go around the room and asked people to share what is their favorite animal and why. 

00:17.100 --> 00:21.000
Okay. My name is Heather and my favorite animal is a dog. 

00:21.100 --> 00:33.000
And the reason that it's my favorite animal, probably a lot of people's favorite animal, because dogs are such loving companions who are so very loyal. 

00:33.100 --> 00:39.000
And I feel like they seem to know when you need them to come snuggle by you. 

00:39.100 --> 00:44.000
They're very perceptive of your feelings and they want to please you. 

00:44.100 --> 00:55.000
And I don't think they're, well there are mean dogs, but overall most dogs are very lovable and only just want to please humans. 

00:55.100 --> 00:59.000
And so I would say dogs are my favorite animal. 

00:59.100 --> 01:00.000
I can go next. 

01:00.100 --> 01:09.000
So, my name Sara, and every once in a while, I actually reflect on a different animal and I feel like I connect with a different one. 

01:09.100 --> 01:13.000
But recently I've been thinking a lot about elephants, and I think elephants are really fascinating. 

01:13.100 --> 01:20.000
They represent, in the African culture, they are a symbol of strength and power. 

01:20.100 --> 01:24.000
And I also think they resemble wisdom. 

01:24.100 --> 01:28.000
So yeah, I just think it's interesting, because we don't get to see them that often. 

01:28.100 --> 01:35.000
Usually, the first thing I would think about, when I'm asked about my favorite animal, I would say a pet animal. 

01:35.100 --> 01:45.000
But yeah, I just find animals in the wild are also very fascinating, very interesting to explore and learn more about them. 

01:45.100 --> 01:57.000
Well, similar to Sara, I'd have to say maybe my favorite animal would be maybe giraffes, because I've always thought they look very, they were very unique. 

01:57.100 --> 02:02.000
And whenever I went to a zoo, or anything like that, I'd always look forward to seeing the giraffes. 

02:02.100 --> 02:04.000
So yeah, I'd say giraffe. 

02:04.100 --> 02:09.000
Maybe ten years ago, if you had asked me my favorite animal, I would have said the horse. 

02:09.100 --> 02:12.000
And they're pretty up there, still. 

02:12.100 --> 02:22.000
But we happened to get a donkey a couple of years ago, because a neighbor was getting a bit older and couldn't look after her anymore himself as easily. 

02:22.100 --> 02:28.000
So, she just came over the fence to our property instead, and he can still visit her. 

02:28.100 --> 02:34.000
But that's the first donkey I'd ever met, and I have to say: she's amazing! 

02:34.100 --> 02:38.000
So, now, I would say my favorite animal is donkeys. 

02:38.100 --> 02:43.000
They're kind of like a horse and a dog, in their personality. 

02:43.100 --> 02:49.000
And I have to say she is smarter than I am; I fully acknowledge that. 

02:49.100 --> 00:02:59.000
Donkeys are quite amazing.
