      "0: Thanks, everybody, for joining me for this short meeting. ",
      "1: What I wanted to do, today, was to go around the room and asked people to share what is their favorite animal and why. ",
      "2: Okay. My name is Heather and my favorite animal is a dog. ",
      "3: And the reason that it's my favorite animal, probably a lot of people's favorite animal, because dogs are such loving companions who are so very loyal. ",
      "4: And I feel like they seem to know when you need them to come snuggle by you. ",
      "5: They're very perceptive of your feelings and they want to please you. ",
      "6: And I don't think they're, well there are mean dogs, but overall most dogs are very lovable and only just want to please humans. ",
      "7: And so I would say dogs are my favorite animal. ",
      "8: I can go next. ",
      "9: So, my name Sara, and every once in a while, I actually reflect on a different animal and I feel like I connect with a different one. ",
      "10: But recently I've been thinking a lot about elephants, and I think elephants are really fascinating. ",
      "11: They represent, in the African culture, they are a symbol of strength and power. ",
      "12: And I also think they resemble wisdom. ",
      "13: So yeah, I just think it's interesting, because we don't get to see them that often. ",
      "14: Usually, the first thing I would think about, when I'm asked about my favorite animal, I would say a pet animal. ",
      "15: But yeah, I just find animals in the wild are also very fascinating, very interesting to explore and learn more about them. ",
      "16: Well, similar to Sara, I'd have to say maybe my favorite animal would be maybe giraffes, because I've always thought they look very, they were very unique. ",
      "17: And whenever I went to a zoo, or anything like that, I'd always look forward to seeing the giraffes. ",
      "18: So yeah, I'd say giraffe. ",
      "19: Maybe ten years ago, if you had asked me my favorite animal, I would have said the horse. ",
      "20: And they're pretty up there, still. ",
      "21: But we happened to get a donkey a couple of years ago, because a neighbor was getting a bit older and couldn't look after her anymore himself as easily. ",
      "22: So, she just came over the fence to our property instead, and he can still visit her. ",
      "23: But that's the first donkey I'd ever met, and I have to say: she's amazing! ",
      "24: So, now, I would say my favorite animal is donkeys. ",
      "25: They're kind of like a horse and a dog, in their personality. ",
      "26: And I have to say she is smarter than I am; I fully acknowledge that. ",
      "27: Donkeys are quite amazing. "
