thanks everybody for joining me for this short meeting 

00:00:04
what I wanted to do today was to go around the room and asked people to share what is their favorite animal and why 

00:00:17
okay hi my name is heather and my favorite animal is a dog and the reason that it's my favorite animal how did a lot of people scare animal 

00:00:27
because dogs are such loving companions who are so very loyal and I feel like they seem to know when you need them to come snuggle by you they're very perceptive of your feelings and they want to please you and I don't think there are well there are mean dogs 

00:00:49
well most dogs are very lovable and only just want to %HESITATION please humans and so I would say dogs are my favorite animal 

00:00:58
I can go next so %HESITATION my name Serra and %HESITATION every once in awhile actually reflecting a different animal and they like it connects with a different one but I recently I've been thinking a lot about elephants and I think offensively fast eating they were present in the African culture they are symbol of strength and power and %HESITATION I also think there are resembled his them so yeah it's just think it's interesting because we don't get to see them that often at seven I'm usually the first thing I would think about when I'm asked about my favorite animal I would say like a pet animal but I I yeah that's fine animals in the wild are also very fascinating very interesting to explore and learn more about them 

00:01:45
similar to Serra and at the same time maybe my favorite animal would be a major routes because of all is that they look very very very unique and whenever I went to a zero or anything like that I always look forward to seeing that Europe so yeah I think the rap 

00:02:04
maybe a ten years ago if you ask me my favorite animal I wouldn't have sent the Hornets and they're pretty up there still but we happen to get a donkey a couple of years ago because a neighbor was getting a bit older and couldn't couldn't look after her anymore himself as easily so she just came over the fence to our property instead and you can still visit her but that's the first junkie I've ever met and I have to say she's amazing so now I would say my favorite animal is donkeys they're kind of like a horse and a dog in their personality and I have to say she is smarter than I am I fully acknowledge that donkeys are quite amazing
