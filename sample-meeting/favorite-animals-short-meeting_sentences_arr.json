"Thanks everybody for joining me for this short meeting.",
"What I wanted to do today was to go around the room and asked people to share what is their favorite animal and why?",
"Okay hi my name is heather and my favorite animal is a dog and the reason that it's my favorite animal.",
"How did a lot of people scare animal, because dogs are such loving companions who are so very loyal and I feel like they seem to know when you need them to come snuggle by you, they're very perceptive of your feelings, and they want to please you and I: don't think there are well, there are mean dogs.",
"Well, most dogs are very lovable and only just want to please humans and so I would say.",
"Dogs are my favorite.",
"Animal I can go next, so my name Serra and every once in awhile, actually reflecting a different animal and they like it, connects with a different one.",
"But I recently I've been thinking a lot about elephants and I think offensively fast eating.",
"They were present in the African culture.",
"They are symbol of strength and power and I also think there are resembled his damn so yeah.",
"It's just think it's interesting, because we don't get to see them that often at seven I'm, usually the first thing I would think about.",
"When I'm asked about my favorite animal I would say like a pet animal but I I yeah, that's fine animals in the wild are also very fascinating, very interesting to explore and learn more about them similar to Serra and at the same time maybe my favorite animal would be a major routes because of all is that they look very, very, very unique and whenever I went to a zero or anything like that, I always look forward to seeing that Europe, so yeah I think the rap.",
"Maybe a ten years ago, if you ask me my favorite animal I wouldn't have sent the Hornets and they're pretty up there still, but we happen to get a donkey a couple of years ago, because a neighbor was getting a bit older and couldn't couldn't look after her anymore himself as easily.",
"So she just came over the fence to our property instead and you can still visit her, but that's the first junkie I've ever met and I have to say she's amazing.",
"So now I would say my favorite animal is donkeys.",
"They're kind of like a horse and a dog in their personality and I have to say she is smarter than I am I fully acknowledge that donkeys are quite amazing."
