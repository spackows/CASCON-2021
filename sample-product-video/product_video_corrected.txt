This video shows you how to create a Watson Studio project. 

00:00:05
From the home page, you can create a project. 

00:00:08
Projects are a way to organize resources for a specific data science task or goal. 

00:00:14
A project includes data, collaborators, notebooks, models and so on, all to support finding insights for a well-defined and fairly narrow goal: for example, how weather affects sales in the company's retail shops. 

00:00:30
In this video, you'll see how to create an empty project, an imported project from a file, and a project based on a sample. 

00:00:39
First, to create an empty project, just provide a name for the project and give it a description. 

00:00:47
By default, the project will be restricted in who can be added as a collaborator. 

00:00:53
So you'll be able to invite anyone in your company or just members of your IBM Cloud account, depending on whether or not your company has SAML federation set up. 

00:01:04
This option also allows you to access assets from a catalog. 

00:01:09
If you clear this restriction, you will be able to invite anyone to collaborate on the project, but you won't be able to access catalog assets. 

00:01:18
This setting can't be changed later. 

00:01:21
If you don't already have an IBM Cloud Object Storage instance, or you want to create a new instance, you'll be able to do that from here. 

00:01:32
When you're ready, click "Create". 

00:01:34
So, here's the new project. 

00:01:36
You'll explore a project a little later. 

00:01:40
Now, let's go back to the home screen and create a project again. 

00:01:45
This time, select the option to create a project from a sample or file. 

00:01:52
Drag the file containing an exported Watson Studio project here. 

00:02:00
Provide a name and a description, then create the project. 

00:02:06
Now, Watson Studio is creating the project space, uploading and extracting the zipped content, and then transferring the files to the Cloud Object Storage instance associated with this project. 

00:02:21
When it's done, you can either view the import summary or view the new project. 

00:02:28
This is the project "Overview" tab, where you see basic information about the project, including: the description, storage usage, collaborators, recent activity, and a project README. 

00:02:44
On the "Assets" tab, you'll find all of the different types of assets you can add to a project, such as: data assets, notebooks, models, flows, and so on. 

00:02:56
On the "Environments" tab, you can define the hardware size and software configuration for the run time associated with Watson Studio tools, such as notebooks. 

00:03:06
The "Jobs" tab shows any scheduled, active, and previous jobs started from running an asset, such as a notebook or Data Refinery flow. 

00:03:16
From here, you can view the details of each job and manage jobs. 

00:03:20
The "Access Control" tab lets you add and manage additional collaborators for your project. 

00:03:27
On the "Settings" tab, you can edit the project name and description. 

00:03:32
Here, you can see the storage used by the assets in this project. 

00:03:37
And here's where you can associate additional services with this project, such as: Spark, Machine Learning, Streaming Analytics, dashboard, or Watson services. 

00:03:48
If you need a project access token to access files and connections using platform APIs, you can create one from here. 

00:03:57
Lastly, you can connect this project to a GitHub repository to be able to upload content there or to your Figure Eight or DefinedCrowd account to create annotation jobs. 

00:04:11
Now, let's go back to the home screen. 

00:04:14
Create a project again and select the option to create a project from a sample or file. 

00:04:21
This time, the project will be based on a sample. 

00:04:25
Hover over each sample to see a description. 

00:04:28
In this case, select the "Predict buying behavior with ML" sample. 

00:04:34
The project name and description are filled in for you, so just click "Create". 

00:04:42
When it's done, view the new project. 

00:04:46
On the "Assets" tab, you'll see the assets included with this sample project. 

00:04:53
Now, you're ready to examine the sample assets and get started analyzing data.
